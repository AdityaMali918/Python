            "Reviews with imagesSee all photosPrevious pageNext pageAll photosAmazon Customer5 out of 5 starsSony Dualsense Controller ReviewOrdered this controller and have used for more than 1 month now. So far I got to say this has to be the best controller I have ever used so far. Probably the best controller money can buy (In my opinion) I mainly use this controller for playing games on my PC and it works really well!! If you want read the entire review and if you don‚Äôt want to read the entire thing scroll down to the conclusion. Compatibility: I was first concerned whether it would work properly on PC as Sony Controllers usually don‚Äôt work properly on PC unless you use some 3rd party software. But, surprisingly I didn‚Äôt have to use any software it works out of the box well as long as game you‚Äôre playing has support for controller. All the games i own are on Steam and the awesome thing is, Steam has proper native support for a PS5 Controller so even if the game actually don‚Äôt support a PS5 Controller, Steam can force support it !! Haptics & Overall Experience: I got to say the haptics in this controller is the best and I prefer this much better to the Xbox Controllers. It is completely different to a regular controller as a regular one has only a rumble type vibration but Sony has used 2 haptic motors and gives you a phone type individual vibration feedback Adaptive Triggers: Not all games have proper support to this feature but I got to test the adaptive triggers on Cyberpunk 2077 and in order for it to work you need to connect via a cable. But, the adaptive triggers is just mind blowing gives you a very realistic feeling & experience this is what mainly blew my mind. Battery Life: Takes some time to charge (around 4-5 hours I guess) but lasts really long so no need to worry about running out of battery in the middle of game definitely it has run for days after gaming daily on it. Build: Honestly speaking the build quality of the controller is really good and buttons and triggers have a good feedback and feel premium as well. Stick Drift or any Issues to be concerned of: So almost everyone‚Äôs who is planning to buy a controller will be concerned about this so called Stick Drift. One thing I‚Äôll say is so far in my > 1 month of usage didn‚Äôt have any issues but there‚Äôs a way you can avoid it or be less worried of if you‚Äôre planning to buy one. Behind the controller there‚Äôs an FCC ID so when you buy one check behind the controller, if you‚Äôre FCC ID ends with a letter A or B or anything greater than that you‚Äôre all good to go and you‚Äôre controller will not get affected with stick drift easily. As Sony has updated their controllers some time back. But, if your controllers FCC ID ends with a number 1 then your controller is most likely to have some fault or issues so better to get it exchanged. Overall I have played games like Wukong, Cyberpunk, Fortnite Conclusion: Thank You! For reading my entire review if you did, then I would honestly recommend this controller to a PC player as well if you‚Äôre planning to buy one. Yes I know an Xbox Controller has better compatibility in Windows but Sony Controllers have the best experience in gaming.MoreHideThank you for your feedbackCloseSorry, there was an errorCloseSorry we couldn't load the reviewTry again\n",
